Here is a list of the libraries that I installed: 
    cmake, face_recognition, numpy, opencv-python.
Install the libraries in one line using PIP library manager:
    pip install cmake face_recognition numpy opencv-python
Import the libraries into the code editor:
    import face_recognition
    import cv2
    import numpy as np
    import os
    import glob
